<p>I am extremely motivated to develop and grow my skills in the engineering industry. I am confident in my abilities to solve complex engineering problems and come up with new ideas and adapt to a new environment. My passion for electrical and electronics started at an early age and since then, I have been interested in pursuing a career in it. I value accountability, and good ethical behaviour and above all I value integrity.</p>
